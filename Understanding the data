Here's a detailed description of the variables:

year = the year the song was released
songtitle = the title of the song
artistname = the name of the artist of the song
songID and artistID = identifying variables for the song and artist
timesignature and timesignature_confidence = a variable estimating the time signature of the song, and the confidence in the estimate
loudness = a continuous variable indicating the average amplitude of the audio in decibels
tempo and tempo_confidence = a variable indicating the estimated beats per minute of the song, and the confidence in the estimate
key and key_confidence = a variable with twelve levels indicating the estimated key of the song (C, C#, . . ., B), and the confidence in the estimate
energy = a variable that represents the overall acoustic energy of the song, using a mix of features such as loudness
pitch = a continuous variable that indicates the pitch of the song
timbre_0_min, timbre_0_max, timbre_1_min, timbre_1_max, . . . , timbre_11_min, and timbre_11_max = variables that indicate the minimum/maximum values over all segments for each of the twelve values in the timbre vector (resulting in 24 continuous variables)
Top10 = a binary variable indicating whether or not the song made it to the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 Chart (1 if it was in the top 10, and 0 if it was not)
